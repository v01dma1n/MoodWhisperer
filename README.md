# VFDWhisperer

An ESP-IDF firmware scaffold for a Sony HT-CT550W front-panel VFD turned
standalone NTP clock with a twist: it whispers mood-driven motivational
and demotivational quotes between time/date scenes.

This is the IDF port of the architecture used by
[GustavClock](https://github.com/v01dma1n/GustavClock) (Arduino / MAX6921)
built on top of
[ESP32NTPClock](https://github.com/v01dma1n/ESP32NTPClock) and
[ESP32NTPClockDrivers](https://github.com/v01dma1n/ESP32NTPClockDrivers).
Class names, extension points, and file layout mirror the originals, so
switching between the Arduino and IDF variants should feel familiar.

## Hardware

| Part              | Role                                           |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Sony 1-883-796-11 | HT-CT550W/UC2 front panel (11 × 16-seg VFD)    |
| Princeton PT6315  | VFD controller (44-pin LQFP)                   |
| ESP32-WROOM       | MCU (38-pin HiLetgo dev board works)           |

CN803 wiring (electrical order — **ignore the mirrored silkscreen labels on
side A**):

| Pin | Signal   | ESP32                |
|-----|----------|----------------------|
| 1   | E3.3V    | 3V3                  |
| 3   | DGND     | GND                  |
| 4   | FL_CLK   | GPIO 18 (VSPI SCK)   |
| 5   | FL_CS    | GPIO 5  (VSPI SS)    |
| 6   | FL_DATA  | GPIO 23 (VSPI MOSI)  |
| 10  | SW4V     | 4 – 5 V supply       |
| 11  | DGND_FL  | GND                  |

SPI settings are 1 MHz, MODE 0, framing is LSB-first (the driver
pre-reverses each byte so IDF's MSB-first bus can emit PT6315 frames
correctly).

## Architecture

### 1. Engine (`components/vfd_ntp_clock`)

Port of ESP32NTPClock. Same class names, different backends:

| Arduino original             | IDF port                                            |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Preferences`                | `nvs_flash` / `nvs_handle_t`                        |
| `ESPAsyncWebServer`          | `esp_http_server` + hand-rolled DNS hijack          |
| `SimpleFSM`                  | 5-state switch inside `ClockFsmManager`             |
| Arduino `SPI` + Arduino SPI  | `driver/spi_master`                                 |
| `HTTPClient`                 | `esp_http_client`                                   |
| `RTClib` (DS1307)            | dropped — the ESP32's internal RTC is sufficient    |
| `Serial.printf`              | `esp_log` macros behind a runtime level gate        |

Key interfaces, unchanged in shape from the Arduino project:

- `IBaseClock` — the contract an app fulfils (SSID, timezone, display, etc.)
- `IDisplayDriver` — one-frame-at-a-time hardware abstraction
- `IAnimation` — per-animation scratch buffer + `update()` / `isDone()`
- `BaseConfig` — generic credentials struct, designed to be subclassed
- `BasePreferences` — NVS-backed loader/saver; subclass to add fields
- `BaseAccessPointManager` — soft-AP + captive portal + form renderer;
  subclass and override `initializeFormFields()` to add rows
- `BaseNtpClockApp` — the "engine" an app inherits from

Everything else (animations, scene manager, FSM, boot manager, SNTP,
WiFi) is internal to the engine and used through those interfaces.

### 2. Drivers (`components/vfd_ntp_clock_drivers`)

Only one driver is relevant for VFDWhisperer — `DispDriverPT6315`. It
wraps a lower-level `SonyVfdPt6315` class (the IDF port of the Arduino
`SonyVFD` library) behind the `IDisplayDriver` interface. Unlike the
MAX6921, the PT6315 multiplexes internally, so there's no need for a
high-priority multiplexing task on core 1.

The 16-segment "Union Jack" glyph table (`sony_vfd_font.cpp`) is ported
verbatim from the Arduino `SonyVFDFont.h`.

### 3. Application (`main/`)

`WhispererApp` is a straight descendant of `BaseNtpClockApp`, one class
per concern just like GustavClock:

- `WhispererPreferences : BasePreferences` — adds display brightness,
  startup-anim toggle, and mood settings on top of `BaseConfig`.
- `WhispererAccessPointManager : BaseAccessPointManager` — adds the
  matching rows to the captive portal.
- `WhispererApp : BaseNtpClockApp` — owns the display driver, the
  display manager, the mood provider, the quote manager, and the
  scene playlist.

---

## Mood system

The user spec was "-1 = very bad, +1 = very good". That is implemented
as-written:

```cpp
class MoodProvider {
public:
    virtual ~MoodProvider() = default;
    virtual float currentMood() = 0;   // always in [-1.0, +1.0]
};
```

Two concrete sources ship in the engine:

- `RandomMoodProvider` — fresh random value on every call. Default for
  bringup when no real mood source exists yet.
- `FixedMoodProvider` — returns a user-chosen constant. Useful for
  demos, and as a manual override the captive portal exposes.

To wire a real mood source later (barometric pressure? cal entries?
button count? LLM call?), subclass `MoodProvider`, write `currentMood()`,
and hand it to `QuoteManager` in `WhispererApp::refreshMoodProvider()`.

`QuoteManager` keeps a table of `Quote{text, minMood, maxMood}` entries,
picks uniformly at random from those whose mood window overlaps the
current mood, and avoids repeating the last few picks. The default table
lives at the top of `quote_manager.cpp` — drop in your own quotes there,
or pass a custom table to the constructor from `WhispererApp`.

---

## Scene playlist

Defined in `whisperer_app.cpp::s_scenePlaylist`. Each entry:

| Field              | Meaning                                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `scene_name`       | label for logs                                             |
| `format_string`    | strftime() if it looks like one, else snprintf() template  |
| `animation_type`   | `STATIC_TEXT` / `SLOT_MACHINE` / `MATRIX` / `SCROLLING`    |
| `duration_ms`      | how long the scene stays up                                |
| `isLiveUpdate`     | re-render once per second (seconds ticker)                 |
| `anim_param_1/2`   | animation-specific timing in ms                            |
| `getDataValue()`   | returns a float that fills `%f` tokens                     |

The quote scene uses a small trick: its `format_string` points at a
mutable static buffer, and its `getDataValue()` callback refreshes that
buffer with the next quote when the scene starts. Because the buffer has
no `%` specifiers, `snprintf()` just copies it verbatim. No engine
changes required.

## Captive portal and timezone handling

**Answer to "can we calculate time zone automatically, or must it be in
setup?":** yes, but not purely — automatic detection needs working WiFi,
and we need the captive portal *before* WiFi. The split:

1. First boot / no credentials stored → AP mode → user enters SSID/password,
   optionally picks a timezone from the dropdown. Defaults to UTC.
2. After WiFi connects successfully, `ClockFsmManager` calls
   `geoFetchPosixTz()` if the stored timezone is blank.
   `ip-api.com/json/?fields=timezone` returns an IANA name ("America/New_York"),
   which gets mapped to one of the POSIX strings in `tz_data.cpp`.
3. The suggestion is logged but not silently persisted — the user is
   expected to confirm it in the portal before save.

Bottom line: **auto-detection is a nice-to-have fill-in, not a substitute
for the setup step.** The portal always has the final say.

The portal is open (no password), rendered in a dark monospace theme
from a single HTTP response (no CDN, no external JS/CSS) at
`http://192.168.4.1/`. Every DNS query on the AP network gets
redirected to the AP's own IP so iOS / Android / macOS / Windows all
pop the captive portal sheet automatically.

Trigger AP mode at any time by pressing reset twice within 5 seconds.
A touch-pad trigger can be added later via `vfd_hardware_map.h`'s
`AP_TRIGGER_GPIO` hook and `ClockFsmManager::requestApMode()`.

---

## Build

Requirements: ESP-IDF ≥ 5.1.

```bash
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
cd VFDWhisperer
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

First boot: the board comes up in AP mode (no credentials stored).
Connect your phone to the open `vfd-whisperer` network, the captive
portal opens, fill in WiFi + timezone, tap save.

## Outstanding work (inherited from the Sony VFD integration)

Two bit-level unknowns carry over from the Arduino driver and need a
one-session bit-walk on the bench to lock down:

1. **DIG1 top-row annunciator bits.** The placeholders in
   `SonyVfdPt6315::annunciatorMap()` for `ANN_AAC_LPCM` ... `ANN_MSTR_HI_RES`
   are guesses. Walk bit by bit and update.
2. **Per-digit annunciator bit.** Assumed to be SG17 (bit 0 of byte 2).
   Verify with e.g. `ANN_NIGHT` and update if wrong.

Neither blocks clock operation — the time/date/quote scenes work without
any annunciators lit.

Other nice-to-haves:

- A real `MoodProvider` source (weather? calendar? BME280 pressure trend?)
- Touch-sensor AP trigger (wire `AP_TRIGGER_GPIO` in `vfd_hardware_map.h`
  and poll it from the app loop into `_fsmManager->requestApMode()`)
- Refactor the quote scene hack (mutable buffer as `format_string`) into
  a first-class `CustomTextSource` scene type in the engine
